    <description>An AI-powered storyteller that uses Claude to dynamically generate events based on your colony's actual situation.

Unlike vanilla storytellers that follow preset curves, Claude analyzes your colony's wealth, defenses, vulnerabilities, recent history, and narrative state to craft contextual events and multi-event story arcs.

FEATURES
- Three event cycles: minor, major, and narrative arcs
- Claude adapts pacing based on how your colony is actually doing
- Exploits your real weaknesses — wooden base? Fire. No turrets? Direct assault.
- Narrative arcs create connected story sequences with evolving themes
- Higher difficulties unlock more chaotic AI behavior

DIFFICULTY LEVELS
- Peaceful/Community Builder: Gentle challenges, positive events
- Adventure Story: Balanced threats and opportunities  
- Strive to Survive: Claude actively hunts weaknesses
- Blood and Dust/Losing is Fun: Unhinged chaos mode

SETUP
1. Get API key from console.anthropic.com
2. Mod Settings > Claude Storyteller > Paste key > Test Connection
3. New game > Select "Claude AI" storyteller

SECURITY
- API key stored locally, never shared except with Anthropic
- Key obfuscated in memory and masked in UI
- Only colony state is transmitted for event decisions

REQUIREMENTS
- Harmony (load before this mod)
- Your own Anthropic API key (~$0.01-0.05/hour gameplay cost)
- Internet connection
