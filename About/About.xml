    <description>An AI-powered storyteller that actually pays attention to your colony.

WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT
Vanilla storytellers follow preset curves. Claude reads your actual situation — wealth, defenses, mood, food, recent events — and makes decisions based on what's really happening. Wooden walls? Fire raid. No doctor? Plague. Thriving? Time to knock you down a peg.

HOW IT WORKS
Claude runs on three cycles:
- Minor Events: Weather, visitors, cargo pods, animals
- Major Events: Raids, infestations, mech clusters, sieges
- Narrative Arcs: Multi-event stories that unfold over time

Each cycle runs independently on randomized timers you control.

DIFFICULTY MATTERS
- Peaceful/Builder: Claude plays nice, focuses on opportunities
- Adventure Story: Balanced — challenges without brutality
- Strive to Survive: Claude actively hunts your weaknesses
- Blood and Dust / Losing is Fun: Unhinged mode — expect the unexpected

SETUP
1. Get an API key from console.anthropic.com (free to create, pay per use)
2. In RimWorld: Mod Settings > Claude Storyteller
3. Click "Change API Key" and paste your key
4. Click "Test API Connection" — should show green checkmark
5. Start new colony, select "Claude AI" as storyteller

TUNING THE SLIDERS
In Mod Settings you can adjust how often each event type fires:
- Minor Events: Default 36-72 game hours (1.5-3 days)
- Major Events: Default 3-7 game days
- Narrative Arcs: Default 4-8 game days

Lower = more frequent. The range adds randomness — Claude picks within your window.

API COSTS
Claude API charges per use. Typical gameplay costs $0.01-0.05 per hour depending on settings. A full 50-hour playthrough might cost $1-2 total.

SECURITY
- Your API key stays on your machine
- Key is masked in the settings UI
- Only colony data is sent to Claude (no personal info)
- Nothing is stored or logged by the mod except locally

REQUIREMENTS
- Harmony (must load before this mod)
- Internet connection during play
- Your own Anthropic API key
